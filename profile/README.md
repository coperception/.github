# About CoPerception
CoPerception is an open-source community jointly maintained by multiple research groups devoted to advancing the research and development of multi-agent collaborative perception for autonomous driving and robotics. 
We welcome contributions from anyone who is interested in this topic and wants to join this fast-growing community.

# How To Join CoPerception
If you are interested in becoming involved with CoPerception, here are some ways you can do so:

üÜï If you have a project related to multi-agent collaborative perception, **you can create your own repository under the CoPerception organization**. To do so, please contact Dr.Feng via email (cfeng at nyu dot edu), or simply [create an issue under this repo](https://github.com/coperception/.github/issues).   

üêõ If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improving our existing repositories, please submit issues or pull requests to our specific repository.

We believe there are many benefits of hosting everyone‚Äôs research project (code/data repository) under this open organization, because it would allow researchers in this emerging community to more easily find new works in this direction.

Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated. We hope you enjoy being part of this growing CoPerception community and look forward to collaborating with you!
